# Newsly - AI-Powered News Aggregation & Verification

## 📌 Overview
Newsly is a self-hosted, AI-powered news aggregation and verification platform designed to combat misinformation and promote accountability. By leveraging a multi-agent system, Newsly scrapes news from various sources, cross-verifies the information, and generates reliable articles and podcasts. The system is designed to ensure transparency in reporting by tracking statements from politicians, crime justice statuses, and other critical societal topics.

## 🎯 Goal & Purpose
- Eliminate fake news and misinformation by cross-referencing multiple sources.
- Provide a reliable and unbiased news aggregation system.
- Track and verify political statements and crime justice updates.
- Benchmark various open-source LLMs for performance and accuracy.
- Ensure data transparency and accountability in news reporting.

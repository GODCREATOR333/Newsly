        Title: NBA power rankings based on NBA Finals odds
Content: Final eight playoff teams by odds to win NBA Finals1. Boston Celtics (-125)The Celtics are odds-on favorites to win the NBA Finals after an excellent regular season. Boston won its first series against the Miami Heat in five games and currently lead the Cleveland Cavaliers, 2-1, in the second round. If the Celtics can keep playing at the levels they did in Games 1 and 3 and get Porzingis back by the Conference Finals, an NBA Finals win would be well within reach.2. Denver Nuggets (+375)The reigning champions flipped the script on the Timberwolves after falling to a 2-0 series deficit at home to begin the second round. After winning both games in Minnesota, the Nuggets have drawn the series even and are back in good position to be the team to come out of the Western Conference. With three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokić and home-court advantage back on their side, Denver are in a great spot to win the West and even the Finals for a second straight year.3. Minnesota Timberwolves

Title: NBA power rankings based on NBA Finals odds
Content: Eight NBA playoff teams remain in the second round as the race for the Larry O'Brien Trophy continues.
Several of the second-round series have drawn even through the first four games, and all eight teams are still in a spot to make a run for the NBA Finals.
According to the latest odds from BetMGM, the talented Boston Celtics are well ahead of the other seven teams in chances to win the NBA Finals. They were the only team to finish the regular season with more than 60 wins and have three players to average more than 20 points per game (Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis).
Here's how all eight remaining playoff teams rank in terms of their odds to win the 2024 NBA Finals.
